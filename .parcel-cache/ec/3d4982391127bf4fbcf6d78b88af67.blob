          <h2>A_bit_about_me</h2>
          <p>
            Born and raised in City Bell, Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the lates
            80's. Last kid from a beautiful young proffesionals family. My
            mother is a Biochemist, my father was an Electrical Engineer. My
            school was quite special, not because I'm a genius -I'm not- but my
            parents believed in a different education's model in which
            challenging yourself and collaborative working are the core values.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in a better future for everyone, although I know the
            world's situation isn't the best it's so far way better than 50
            years ago. I hold some hope. I like reading, cooking, biking,
            skating, travelling, swimming, jumping, dancing, living!. I love
            sustainability, grow my own vegetables, utilize my stuff till is
            O-V-E-R. A puzzle solving mind, a neat guy.

            How do I arrived to IT? Well, a bunch of reasons I think, but the
            main one is that I grew up surrounded of people related with IT.

          <p>
            After the school I went to study Anthropology, at Universidad
            Nacional de La Plata, Argentina. As interesting topics for my actual
            profession I've learned Mathematics and Statistics. When I was
            finishing my degree subjects I decided to open a small biological
            grocerie's store. There I did my website, Wordpress + Woocommerce,
            and the marketing stuff, among all the other business daily tasks.
            Five years later I decided to move forward because I felt myself
            stuck doing everyday exactly the same, like "The groundhog's day",
            with Bill Murray. I would I fully enjoyed those years and I've got
            tons of learnings about life and proffesion. Right after I began
            working doing Digital Marketing and to study Web Development in
