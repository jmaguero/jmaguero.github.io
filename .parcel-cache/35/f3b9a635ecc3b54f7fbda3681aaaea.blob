<h2>A bit about me</h2>
<p>Born and raised in Argentina, 1987's.
 Last kid from a beautiful young proffesionals family, as well the unique boy. Before me, 3 girls.
 My childhoodness was in a high technificated environment. My mother is a Biochemistry, my father was a Power Engineer, so I grew up between 
rare machines, electric arcs and then.
I went to a special school, not because I'm a genius but my parents believed in a different kind of education. A model 
of education in which competence was not the main topic, a one in which collaborative working is the main topic. 
<br><q>The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. â€“ Phil Jackson</q>

How I arrived to IT?
Well, I have some cousins related with graphic design and website development, they're <a rel="stylesheet" href="d49f1cbac74d659c1623a772bbe16df0">Bigital</a>, they're the first wave of designers, when html and internet became popular. As well one my wonderful sisters is a visual designer and web developer, she's <a rel="stylesheet" href="cb5b1cc2f2df9fbb5a5331d921013ce2">Esencia Visual</a> 
as well she's one of my favourite persons in this world. But that's another story. <br>
So, when I was 15 years old I'd been experimenting with web development with dreamweaver. Nothing serious to be totally honest.
When I finished my high school I went to the university to study Anthropology </p>
