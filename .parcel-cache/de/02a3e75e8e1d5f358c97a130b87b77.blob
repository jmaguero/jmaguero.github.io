<h2>A bit about me</h2>
<p>Born and raised in Argentina, 1987's.
 Last kid from a beautiful young proffesionals family, as well the unique boy. Before me, 3 girls.
 My childhoodness was in a high technificated environment. My mother is a Biochemistry, my father was a Power Engineer, so I grew up between 
rare machines, electric arcs and then.
I went to a special school, not because I'm a genius but my parents believed in a different kind of education. A model 
of education in which competence was not the main topic, a one in which collaborative working is the main topic.
