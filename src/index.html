            <p>
              Born and raised in City Bell, Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the
              lates 80's. Last kid from a beautiful young professionals family.
              Mother Biochemist, my father was an Electrical Engineer.
              Quite special school, not because I'm a genius -I'm not-
              but my parents believed in a different education model in which
              challenging yourself and collaborative working were core
              values.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in a better future for everyone in this world, although I know world's situation isn't the best it's so far way better than 50
              years ago. I hold some hope. I like reading, cooking, biking,
              skating, travelling, swimming, jumping, dancing, living!. I fight for
              sustainability, I try to grow my own vegetables and, use my stuff till is
              O-V-E-R, it means totally warned out!. A puzzle solving mind, a neat guy.

              How do I arrived to IT? Well, a bunch of reasons I think, but the
              main one is that I grew up surrounded of people related with IT.

            <p>
              After the school I studied Anthropology, at Universidad
              Nacional de La Plata, Argentina. As relevant topics for my
              actual profession I've learned Mathematics and Statistics. When I
              was finishing my degree subjects I decided to open a small
              biological grocerie's store. There I did my website, Wordpress +
              Woocommerce, and the marketing stuff, among all other's business
              daily tasks. Five years later I decided to move forward because I
              felt myself stuck doing everyday exactly the same, like "The
              groundhog's day" movie, with Bill Murray. I fully enjoyed those
              years and I've got tons of learnings about life, work, human beings and how the world works.
              Right after I began working doing Digital Marketing and to study Web Development in
